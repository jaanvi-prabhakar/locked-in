# Locked In: A Gamified Productivity Tool

Welcome to the official documentation for **Locked In**: a simple, powerful, and gamified goal-tracking application.

## Introduction

**Locked In** is a gamified productivity tool that helps users stay focused by visually tracking goals with due dates and priorities. Inspired by minimalist design and interactive engagement, it aims to create a "flow state" experience for personal and professional productivity.

### Key Features
- Add and manage goals
- Assign due dates and priorities
- Mark goals complete or undo completion
- Sort and filter goals
- Priority tag visualization
- (Planned) Gamification with streaks and badges

### Component Breakdown
- **Frontend**: React with modular components and basic routing
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (WebFlux for async/non-blocking support)
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Spring Data Reactive Mongo)
